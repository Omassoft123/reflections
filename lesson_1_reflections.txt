How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it made it easier to compare becuase of seeing only the code that contains 
    differences and seeing these lines at the same place.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    it will help me to avoid old mistakes and use old code that was working better.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
	complete commits pieces of code
	reasonable commits
    Cons:
	losing work if not saved before an expected event such as computer crash

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Becasue it is designed for interrelated files systems such as coding systems

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log to get the whole repository history, and use git diff to compare
    between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I dont know!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Yes
